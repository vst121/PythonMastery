# Python Mastery

Welcome to **Python Mastery**, a comprehensive project designed to systematically review and master Python's capabilities.

## Project Mission
This project serves as a structured review of **Python abilities** and acts as a strategic **gate to AI Engineering**. It bridges the gap between core programming excellence and the specialized requirements of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Advanced Mastery Demonstrations
This project contains a series of specialized scripts exploring advanced Python concepts:

| File | Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `args_kwargs_demo.py` | **Flexible Arguments** | Use of `*args` and `**kwargs` for variable length inputs. |
| `dunder_methods_demo.py` | **Magic Methods** | Operator overloading and custom object behavior using `__str__`, `__add__`, etc. |
| `context_managers_demo.py` | **Resource Management** | Handling setup/teardown with `with` blocks and `@contextmanager`. |
| `metaclasses_demo.py` | **Metaprogramming** | Using metaclasses to control class creation and enforce standards. |
| `abstract_base_classes_demo.py` | **Interfaces (ABCs)** | Defining strict blueprints and API contracts for subclasses. |
| `multiple_inheritance_demo.py` | **MRO & Mixins** | Understanding Method Resolution Order and composing behaviors with Mixins. |
| `async_await_demo.py` | **Concurrency** | Non-blocking execution and event loops using `asyncio`. |
| `monkey_patching_demo.py` | **Runtime Modification** | Dynamically altering code behavior for testing or bug fixes. |
| `memory_management_demo.py` | **Garbage Collection** | Deep dive into reference counting and circular references. |

## Core Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: `singleton_pattern_demo.py` - Ensuring single instances for loggers/configs.
- **Factory Pattern**: `factory_pattern_demo.py` - Object creation abstraction.
- **Strategy Pattern**: `strategy_pattern_demo.py` - Encapsulating interchangeable algorithms (e.g., discounts).
- **Command Pattern**: `command_pattern_demo.py` - Encapsulating requests as objects with undo support.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: `chain_of_responsibility_demo.py` - Passing requests along a chain of handlers.
- **Adapter Pattern**: `adapter_pattern_demo.py` - Bridging incompatible interfaces.
- **Proxy Pattern**: `proxy_pattern_demo.py` - Intercepting object access.
- **Composite Pattern**: `composite_pattern_demo.py` - Tree structures and part-whole hierarchies.

## Getting Started
To begin your journey through Python mastery:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run any demo file individually, e.g., `python async_await_demo.py`.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the root for interactive learning.
