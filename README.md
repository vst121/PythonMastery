# Python Mastery

Welcome to **Python Mastery**, a comprehensive project designed to systematically review and master Python's capabilities.

## Project Mission
This project serves as a structured review of **Python abilities** and acts as a strategic **gate to AI Engineering**. It bridges the gap between core programming excellence and the specialized requirements of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Python Syntax**: Deep dives into decorators, context managers, and metaclasses.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Orchestrating complex workflows with `asyncio`.
- **Data Engineering**: Handling data efficiently for AI pipelines.
- **AI Integration**: Demonstrating how Python powers modern AI frameworks.

## Getting Started
To begin your journey through Python mastery:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `python app.py` to see the core demonstration.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the root for interactive learning.
